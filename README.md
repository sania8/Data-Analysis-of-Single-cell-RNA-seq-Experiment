🔬 Single-cell RNA-seq Data Analysis README 🔬

🔍 Overview:
This repository contains the analysis workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data, including preprocessing steps, visualization, and clustering.

📊 Analysis Steps:
1. 🧬 Read gene expression matrix to determine cell and gene count.
2. 🎯 Assess gene spread, filtering out mitochondrial RNA for quality control.
3. 🔍 Filter cells based on threshold values.
4. 📉 Analyze variation in gene expression across cells.
5. ✨ Select features (e.g., gene expressions between 0.02 and 4) for further analysis.
6. 🔄 Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction.
7. 📊 Use Leiden Algorithm to cluster cells based on gene expression patterns.

🌟 Additional Information:
- 💡 The project aims to uncover cellular heterogeneity and identify distinct cell populations based on gene expression patterns.
- 🛠️ Various visualization techniques and algorithms are employed to gain insights into the data.
